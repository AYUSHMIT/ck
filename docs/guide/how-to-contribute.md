# How to contribute

Collective Knowledge framework (CK) uses standard 3-clause (new) BSD license. 
Contributions are very welcome to improve the existing functionality 
of the CK framework, CK modules, and CK components.

You can easily contribute to CK and all related repositories by forking them 
on GitHub and then submitting a pull request. We strongly suggest you 
to discuss your PR with the community using the public CK google group:
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge

Since most CK modules and components are reused in different projects, 
please make sure that you thoroughly tested your contributions 
and they are backward compatible!

When sending PRs, please briefly explain why they are needed,
how their work, and how you tested backward compatibility
to make sure that dependent projects continue working correctly.

Please submit bug reports, feedback, and ideas here:
* https://github.com/ctuning/ck/issues

Check this [outdated guide](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki) to add your workflows and components. 
We are gradually rewriting this guide and developing [cBench](https://github.com/ctuning/cbench) to simplify
the user experience and provide a CK GUI at the [open cKnowledge.io platform](https://cKnowledge.io).

*Note that we plan to rewrite CK and make it more pythonic and user-friendly
when we have more resources! Feel free to [get in touch](https://cKnowledge.org/contacts.html)
if you would like to know more about our future R&D plans.*

**Thank you very much for supporting this community project!**
