CK framework documentation
==========================

.. epigraph::

Collective Knowledge framework (CK) helps you to organize your project
as a database of reusable components with common automation actions
and extensible meta descriptions based on FAIR principles
(findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability).

The ultimate goal is to help everyone share, reuse, and extend their knowledge
in the form of reusable artifacts and portable workflows with a common API, CLI,
and JSON meta description. 

See some real-world use cases from Arm, General Motors, IBM, MLPerf, the Raspberry Pi foundation, 
and ACM to support collaborative and reproducible AI, ML, and systems R&D 
at https://cKnowledge.org/partners.
