CK framework documentation
==========================

.. epigraph::

Collective Knowledge framework (CK) provides a common API with reusable
automation actions to all software projects together with a database-like
control for their individual components including algorithms, packages,
data sets, models, and results. The goal is to make it easier for
researchers and practitioners to reuse best R&D practices and artifacts,
assemble portable workflows, reproduce and compare research techniques,
build upon them, and use them in production. See some real-world use cases
from Arm, General Motors, IBM, MLPerf, RPi, and ACM at https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html.
