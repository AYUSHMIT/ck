# Collective Knowledge framework (CK)

## News

* **2020 August**: We are very excited to announce that we have completed 
  the prototyping phase of the Collective Knowledge framework (CK)
  and successfully validated it in several [industrial and academic projects](https://cKnowledge.org/partners)
  as briefly described in this [white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07161)
  and the [CK presentation](https://cKnowledge.io/presentation/ck).
  We have helped our partners and the community to use CK as a playground to implement reusable 
  [components]( https://cknowledge.io/?q=%22digital-component%22 ) with [automation actions]( https://cKnowledge.io/actions ) 
  for AI, ML, and systems R&D while agreeing on common APIs and JSON meta descriptions. 
  We then used such components to assemble [portable workflows](https://cknowledge.io/programs)
  from [reproduced research papers](https://cknowledge.io/reproduced-papers) during 
  the so-called [artifact evaluation](https://cTuning.org/ae).
  We also  demonstrated that it was possible to use such portable workflows 
  to automate the complex co-design process of efficient software, hardware and models, 
  simplify [MLPerf benchmark](https://mlperf.org) submissions,
  and [quickly deploy]( https://cKnowledge.io/solution )  emerging AI, ML, and IoT technology in production
  in the [most efficient way (speed, accuracy, energy, costs)]( https://cKnowledge.io/results ) 
  across diverse platforms from supercomputers and data centers to mobile phones and edge devices.

  *We are now raising funding for the second phase of this project to standardize CK APIs and meta descriptions, 
  make CK more pythonic and user-friendly, and enhance our [open CK platform](https://cKnowledge.io). 
  Our mission is to organize all AI, ML, and systems knowledge in the form of portable workflows
  with reusable automation actions and artifacts
  to accelerate the development and adoption of innovative technology -

## Overview

**You can read about our motivation to create CK at [cKnowledge.org](https://cKnowledge.org)**

We have developed the Collective Knowledge framework (CK) to help our colleagues, students, researchers and practitioners
share their projects and artifacts (code, data, models, scripts, experiments, papers)
as a human-readable database ([CK repository]( https://cKnowledge.io/repos )) 
with unified API, CLI, JSON input/output/meta descriptions
and [reusable automation actions](https://cKnowledge.io/actions).

For example, CK features 
[software detection plugins](https://cKnowledge.io/soft), 
[meta packages](https://cKnowledge.io/packages) 
and [OS descriptions](https://cKnowledge.io/c/os)
to automate the detection and installation of [all the dependencies](https://cknowledge.io/c/solution/mlperf-inference-v0.5-detection-openvino-ssd-mobilenet-coco-500-linux/#dependencies) 
including data sets and models required by a given research project to run on any target platform.

Such CK actions and components can be connected into platform-agnostic, 
portable, customizable and reproducible [program pipelines](https://cKnowledge.io/programs) 
and [functional solutions](https://cKnowledge.io/solutions)
that can be used with Continuous Integration tools, 
existing/legacy projects, and production systems.

The stable components, portable workflows and solutions are published along 
with [reproduced papers](https://cKnowledge.io/reproduced-papers) 
at the [open Collective Knowledge platform](https://cKnowledge.io).
They provide a unified way to benchmark, optimize, test and co-design
software and hardware for emerging technoligies (AI, ML, quantum, IoT)
across diverse hardware, datasets and models using [public scoreboards](https://cKnowledge.io/results)

Our long-term goal is to enable collaborative, reproducible, sustainable and production-ready deep tech research (AI, ML, quantum, IoT).

*Even though the CK technology is used [in production](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) for more than 5 years, it is still a proof-of-concept prototype requiring further improvements and standardization. Depending on the available resources, we plan to develop a new, backward-compatible and more user-friendly version - please [get in touch](https://cKnowledge.org/contacts.html) if you are interested to know more!*
