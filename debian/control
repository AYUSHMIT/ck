Description: enabling collaborative and reproducible research and experimentation
 .
 Collective Knowledge (CK) is a light-weight, portable, modular
 and python-based framework, repository, web service and SDK 
 to organize, describe, cross-link and share user code, data,
 experimental setups and meta information as unified 
 and reusable components with JSON API via standard 
 Git services (such as GITHUB or BitBucket).
 .
 Such unification can help researchers assemble experimental setups
 (workflows, pipelines, etc) from shared components just as LEGO(TM)
 to quickly prototype ideas while automating, preserving, 
 distributing, crowdsourcing and reproducing experiments.
 .
 Furthermore, CK simplifies connection of unified experiments 
 to powerful predictive analytics tools such as scikit-learn 
 and R (statistical analysis, data mining,  machine learning)
 to automate and speed up exploration of multi-dimensional
 experimental choices, analysis of results and decision making.
 .
 For example, we use this framework primarily to systematize, 
 open and crowdsource our research on how to design faster, 
 smaller, more power efficient and reliable software and hardware 
 (by combining autotuning, run-time adaptation, machine learning 
 and public repository of knowledge) as described in the following
